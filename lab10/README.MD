Lab 10 - AspectJ and FeatureIDE

Lab 10 vs Lab 1
    The solution for lab 10 involves AspectJ and its uses in making code easier to manage. AspectJ allows us to change the configuration of a class through the config file, also giving us more flexibility in how we want to structure our code.
    For example, the Gumball Machine for which we implemented various versions of in Lab 1 can be made simpler with AspectJ through this configuration feature.
